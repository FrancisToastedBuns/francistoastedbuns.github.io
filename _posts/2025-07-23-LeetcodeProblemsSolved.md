            Important Note
        </strong>
        Many LeetCode problems belong to multiple categories, so the sum of individual category solves may exceed my total problem count.

    title Coding Journey
    2024 : Started LeetCode
    2024 Q2 : First 100 problems
    2025 Q1 : Reached 200
    Now : 350+ and counting

## **Why I Solve Leetcode Problems**  
- **Interview Readiness**: I want to essentially ready myself just incase of coding assessments
- **It Avoids Stagnation**: While LeetCode may not directly improve real-world software engineering skills, it serves as valuable mental exercise
- **Teaching Value**: Streamlined guides for beginners.
